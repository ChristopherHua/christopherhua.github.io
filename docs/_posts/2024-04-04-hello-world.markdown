I've been working as a software engineer for almost 10 years now and I've never made a personal website! 

Github Pages made it incredibly easy. Perhaps, too easy. As I look back on the time I've spent working in this field I've noticed that I seemed to have lost a bit of the curiosity and passion for learning I once had as a programmer. With some of the big changes I've recently faced I'm looking to recapture that passion I once felt. I'm hoping to post regular updates here to track my progress.
